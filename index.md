## About Me

Hello! :wave:

I'm Galia! Welcome to my digital space. I find joy in exploring data and uncovering the stories it tells. My journey has equipped me with various tools like SQL, Python, and PowerBI that help me transform complex information into clear insights. This site gives you a glimpse into my approach to problem-solving and some of the projects I've worked on along the way. If you're interested, you can check out my [resume](/assets/docs/CV_Galia_Appel.pdf) for my background or browse through some of my [portfolio projects](/portfolio/). I'm always open to new challenges and opportunities to collaborate with like-minded teams.
